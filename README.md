# UFOs

# Project Overview 
For this project, I built a table using stored Javascript arrays. Throughout the module we iterated on the table in order to make it dynamic and have multiple filters.

## Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria.
For this deliverable we added more filters to the table.

## UFO Sightings Result Page
The final output of this project is a webpage that includes five different filters including Date, City, State, Country, and Shape. Based on what is entered into the filters, we will be given UFO sighting information related to the filters.

## Summary 

### Drawback of the Webpage
  * I don't think that using five filters is very user friendly.
  * Instead of search boxes, we could use dropdowns.
